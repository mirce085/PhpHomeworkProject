The Driving Experience Management System is a web-based application developed using PHP and MySQL to record, manage, and analyze users' driving experiences. The system allows users to log their driving trips, track performance, and generate reports to evaluate and improve their driving habits. It supports two main roles: users and administrators. Users can register and log in to enter trip details, including the date, time, distance covered, average speed, weather conditions, road type, and any driving challenges faced. They can view, edit, or delete their trip logs and access a performance dashboard displaying metrics like average speed, driving hours, and progress over time.
